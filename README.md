Schoolelo: croudsourced university rankings

##How does it work?

SchoolElo uses the [elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to produce these rankings. When you click on the 'new match' button above, two colleges are chosen at random and presented head-to-head. After you select the winner (or declare a tie!), both school's elo ratings are recalculated. As hundreds of games are played, relatively clear rankings should hopefully emerge.

##How did you decide which schools to include?

Simple: I took the top forty universities and the top ten liberal arts colleges from the US News rankings. Although this probably means that some good schools weren't included, it was a decent arbitrary cutoff: all of the schools generally considered "top" are on our list (ivies, MIT, Stanford, top public universities, etc.) Apologies if your favorite school wasn't included!

##Is this a good indicator of a school's quality?

Absolutely not. For two main reasons:

1. The results are produced by direct comparisons of two schools, which is not at all representative of how a college should be judged.

2. These rankings are generated entirely based off user's responses, so in the best case they can be thought of as a decent approximation of a school's 'prestige rating'. Realistically, the results are bound to be skewed by some bias in the sample of whoever actually visits the site, and will not be of use at all.

Either way, it's all just for fun... so don't worry too much about the results; they don't really mean anything! (However, if you think the rankings are inaccurate, your best bet is to spam the new match button above and make your opinion count! ðŸ¤ )
